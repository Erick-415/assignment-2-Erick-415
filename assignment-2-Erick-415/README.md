## CSC-317 - Assignment 2 - HTML (Individual Assignment)

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment. You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

Create a website entirely in HTML on any (class appropriate) topic. The focus is to get the skeleton of an HTML page. You may add minimal CSS, but no Javascript yet.

The site must be coded by hand (i.e. no using HTML generators, AI, templates, frameworks, or anything other than your own typing of code)

The site must have a Home page (usually index.html), an About page, and a Contact page. All pages, images, etc. must be included here.

You should be able to navigate from any page on the site to any other page of the site. Layout and navigation should be consistent from page to page.

**_The home page:_**  has to have a nice look and at least 3 images on it. Change the background color and font (to something appealing). Use a color scheme picker. 

**_The about page:_**  should have similar navigation to the home page and information about the site (or about you, name, github name, hobbies, interests).

**_The contact page:_**  should have an HTML form (it will not do anything yet since we have not connected a back-end), but should have at least the following fields:
> 		First Name
> 		Last Name
> 		Email Address
> 		Street Address
> 		City
> 		State (drop down)
> 		ZipCode
> 		Password
		
Then it should have at **_least 4 more fields_** you decide.

The fields should be laid out in a user friendly fashion and be appropriate type fields with appropriate HTML error checking. Note the state field should have all states. One trick to do this is search google for "html select input for all 50 states", then copy and paste that blob. This is allowed.

**_Extra Credit:_**	Add additional relevant pages to your site that contain unique elements (such as an FAQ page), add them to navigation.

Like our first assignment, this should be accessible from our Dev Server.

Submission:  All the files should be organized and submitted to github from the assigned repository.  A PDF writeup (use template) that includes a description of what you did, the logic and design of what you did, problems encountered and how you overcame them and screen shots of your pages (use a full page for each screen shot). 

The PDF must be included in your repository AND also submitted to Canvas.
